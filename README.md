# Ahmed Badawy
Senior Cloud Architect & Platform Engineer

I design and evolve secure, scalable, cost-efficient cloud platforms (AWS + multi-cloud) and turn architecture into repeatable delivery with IaC, CI/CD, and strong governance.

- Current focus: Cloud architecture, landing zones, governance, and FinOps-driven design
- Strength: Architecture decisions with hands-on execution (platform, SRE, DevOps)
- Interested in: Platform engineering, cloud governance, reliability, observability, cost optimization

## What I do
- Cloud architecture design (AWS / multi-cloud), reference architectures, target-state roadmaps
- Architecture as Code (Terraform, Terragrunt; patterns, modules, blueprints)
- Cloud governance (account strategy, IAM boundaries, tagging, budgets, anomaly detection)
- Reliability engineering (SLOs, observability by design, incident reduction)
- Cost-aware architecture (FinOps practices embedded in engineering workflows)
- Diagramming & modeling (Mermaid, PlantUML, Diagrams-as-code in Python)

## Tech stack
Cloud: AWS, GCP  
IaC: Terraform, Terragrunt (plus modular blueprints)  
Containers: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, ECS/Fargate  
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitOps, ArgoCD, Harness  
Observability: Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, SignalFx  
Security: IAM design, encryption, network isolation, policy enforcement (GDPR/SOC2-aligned)  
Code: Python, Bash (plus Java/Go exposure)

## Recent work highlights
Bondora (Senior Cloud Architect / Platform Engineer)
- Designed cloud architectures aligned with business growth, compliance, and cost targets
- Defined reusable architecture blueprints with Terraform/Terragrunt and governance guardrails
- Embedded FinOps, reliability, and observability requirements into platform architecture

CyberCube (Cloud Architect / Platform Tech Lead)
- Designed cloud-native AWS architectures and target-state migration designs
- Standardized infrastructure patterns and embedded SLO/observability into platform design

## Selected projects (add links when public)
- Contract Renewal Automation: automated renewal workflows with governance and auditability
- PII Shield: data-protection controls, isolation, encryption, and audit-oriented patterns

## Architecture artifacts
- Diagrams as code: Mermaid / PlantUML / Python Diagrams
- ADRs: decision logs for trade-offs (cost vs performance vs reliability)
- Reference architectures: landing zones, network segmentation, IAM boundaries, observability baselines
